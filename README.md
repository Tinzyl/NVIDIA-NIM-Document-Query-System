# 🤖 NVIDIA NIM Document Query System

This project is a **Streamlit-based application** that leverages NVIDIA's NIM (Neural Information Model) for processing and querying documents. It combines **LangChain** for vector embeddings, document retrieval, and chunk-based summarization with NVIDIA's cutting-edge AI models for intelligent, context-aware answers.
